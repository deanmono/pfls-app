### How do I get set up? ###

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.7.

Run `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install Anguler CLI.

After cloning the x-ui project, run `npm install` from within the x-ui directory.  This only needs to be done once, or when new modules are added to the project.

#### Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
